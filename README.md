# ZEYODA MVP for GOSHEESH

A cosmic, decentralized launchpad for artists to share token-gated content. This MVP is designed for GOSHEESH, the first artist on the platform.

## 🌌 Project Overview

ZEYODA is an artist-first interactive interface where:
- Fans access exclusive content via NFC/QR coin, social share, or direct link
- The experience is simple, magical, and sacred - built for music fans, not crypto enthusiasts
- Users can support artists directly with a single payment (Venmo, PayPal, credit card, or crypto)
- Each payment unlocks an "artistock" - permanent access to the track

## ✨ Features

- Cosmic ambient background with shimmering particles
- Centered video portal for featured content
- Tokens orbiting around the video like a planetary system
- Passwordless, one-click authentication
- Simple payment flow with multiple options
- Chat-based interface for all interactions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. For the best experience, view on a mobile device or use mobile device emulation in your browser

No server setup required - this is a client-side only application.

## 📝 Development Notes

- The current implementation is a prototype/MVP for demonstration purposes
- Authentication and payment are simulated (no actual transactions occur)
- The wallet creation is mocked for the user experience flow
- Video source is a placeholder - replace with actual GOSHEESH content
- Mobile-first design optimized for smartphone viewing

## 🔮 Future Development

- Multiple artist support with horizontal scrolling between artists
- Vertical scrolling within an artist's content
- Persistent wallet storage using Web3Auth or similar solution
- Real payment processing integration
- Expanded token-gated content options

## 💫 Cosmic Tech Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling with animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth orbit animations
- Trigonometric functions for circular movement of tokens
